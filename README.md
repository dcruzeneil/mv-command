Implementing a C program that uses the structures used to represent a file in UFS2 (Unix File System) - superblock, inode structs, and direct structs - to rename a file.

Usage:
./rename [PATH TO RAW IMAGE OF DISK PARTITION] [FILE/DIRECTORY TO RENAME] [NEW NAME]

Limitations:
No error handling in case wrong path is provided.
